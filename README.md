# Alphabetize
An Organizational tool for large media libraries: such as music, videos, books, video games, etc.

Has two functions:
1. Alphabetize! Will take a target folder's contents and move them into sub-folders "A"-"Z" based on each the first letter of each file within the target folder. Files beginning with any number (0-9) will be placed into a folder named "#".

2. Undo. Will undo the Alphabetize! function by moving all the contents within the sub-folders of the target folder back into the target folder. Empty folders named "#" or "A"-"Z" will be deleted upon completion.
