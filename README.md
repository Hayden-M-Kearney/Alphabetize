# Alphabetize-v1.3
An Organizational tool for large media libraries: such as music, videos, books, video games, etc.

Has two functions:
1. Alphabetize!: Will move the target folder's contents into Alphabetized! sub-folders 'A'-'Z' with a '#' folder for contents starting with numbers and an '.Other' folder for contents starting with any other character.

2. Undo: Will undo the Alphabetize! function by moving all the contents within the sub-folders, of the target folder, back into the target folder. Empty folders named "#", "A"-"Z", or ".Other" will be deleted upon completion.

If Alphabetize! has helped you, consider buying me a drink at: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/HaydenKearney

Thank you!
